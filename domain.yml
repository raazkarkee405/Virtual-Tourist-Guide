  utter_search_language_resuts:
  - text: With over 120 different variations, Nepali is the main language in Nepal
      however, in main cities, English is also widely spoken. As the tourism and trekking
      industry in Nepal is thriving, English is widely spoken (or at least understood)
      by most people that you encounter during your trek. From personal experience,
      while there are still a few sherpas who didn’t speak English, most of them could
      understand more than they could speak.
